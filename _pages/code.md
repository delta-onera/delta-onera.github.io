# Code and Software

## SegNet implementation with PyTorch

[SegNet](http://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/projects/segnet/) is a deep network for image segmentation.
We propose [here](https://github.com/delta-onera/segnet_pytorch) an imlpementation using the [PyTorch](pytorch.org) framework.

## ShaResNet

[ShaResNet](https://github.com/aboulch/sharesnet) is a deep residual neural architecture.
Compared to usual ResNets, the ShaResNets are lighter (between 20% and 45% less parameters) and offer similar performances.
