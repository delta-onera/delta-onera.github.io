# Code and Software

## Samples
Tutorial and/or code samples for deep learning applications can be found [here](https://github.com/delta-onera/sample).

## Network architectures

#### SegNet implementation with PyTorch

[SegNet](http://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/projects/segnet/) is a deep network for image segmentation.
We propose [here](https://github.com/delta-onera/segnet_pytorch) an imlpementation using the [PyTorch](pytorch.org) framework.

#### ShaResNet

[ShaResNet](https://github.com/aboulch/sharesnet) is a deep residual neural architecture.
Compared to usual ResNets, the ShaResNets are lighter (between 20% and 45% less parameters) and offer similar performances.

## 3D processing

#### SnapNet for point cloud labeling

[SnapNet](https://sites.google.com/view/boulch/publications/2017_3dor_pointclouds) is framework for unstructured point cloud labeling. By taking snapshots of the point set, the 3D labeling problem becomes a 2D semantic segmentation problem, that is solved using deep segmentation networks. The code is available [here](https://github.com/aboulch/sharesnet).
