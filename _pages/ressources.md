## Deep Machine learning frameworks

#### [Tensorflow](www.tensorflow.org)

#### [Torch](http://torch.ch/) and [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/)

Torch is Lua framework for deep neural networks.
It is very efficient and easy to set up.
It is based on the THNN, c++ library.
Pytorch is the Python interface for THNN.
This library is used in several labs from Facebook AI to ENS (France).

#### [Caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/)

Caffe is a popular framework, C++ based with Python interface.
It uses configuration files `.prototxt` for networks definition and optimization parametrization.
Caffe benefits from a very complete [model zoo](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/wiki/Model-Zoo) with numerous pre-trained models.

#### [MatConvNet](http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/)

MatConvNet is a deep learning framework for Matlab.

#### [NVidia Digits](https://developer.nvidia.com/digits)

Digits is high end interface for deep learning developped by NVidia.
It provides an attractive view of the optimization state.
The surpported deep learning frameworks are currently Torch and Caffe.
